### [v0.18.0] - 2026-09-16 — In Progress
1. **Campaign Atlas and system inspector:** A left tray beside Help connects system information, body selection, and campaign records. Click a system to inspect it; double-click to open its orbit view. Orbit rings have an explicit checkbox and adjustable strength. Existing pan, bulk-selection, and route-picking gestures are preserved.
2. **Orbit view lineup:** The Time & orbits controls include a Lineup switch. Orbits is the live orrery. Horizontal lines the star and every world up left to right, in orbit order, with even spacing, orbit arcs behind them, moons on their rings, and a planetoid belt drawn as a band of rocks. Vertical does the same top to bottom, star at the top. Names sit under the row or beside the column. Fit system, pan, zoom, follow, and double-click framing still apply.
3. **Campaign records and images:** Manage people, places, businesses, organizations, jobs, events, items, and notes for the current system. Local portraits and galleries support primary selection, ordering, captions, credits, and replacement. Records and images survive regeneration, browser autosave, map/system JSON transfers, and undo/redo. Campaign content remains referee-only and excluded from wiki exports.
4. **Portable backups:** Multipart map saves partition by UTF-8 size and carry all shared metadata plus image payloads in Part 1. Imports validate campaign schemas and image data before changing the map, and offer a merge choice where campaign records already exist.
5. **Sample campaign:** Settings includes a Traveller sample of twelve records in each campaign category, each with an image. Load sample campaign adds them to the current browser session and spreads them across systems already on the map. Ctrl+Z removes that load. An empty map still receives the records, attached to hexes in sector 1.
6. **Painted highports:** The orbit view's highport is now one of four painted stations (A and B full rings, C a three-quarter ring, E a cross; D uses the E art) instead of a drawn ring and spars. It is kept small, a quarter of the world's radius, downscaled once per on-screen size so it stays crisp, and carries a breathing glow in the port's colour, a pulsing hub, red and green navigation lights blinking in turn on its spar tips, and white double-flash strobes on its docking modules. In the world's shadow the hull goes dark and the lights stay on.
7. **Orbit view hover card:** Hovering a body in the orbit view now shows its card parked in the map's top left corner, with a short slide-in and corner brackets, instead of at the cursor where it covered the body close up.
8. **Edits stay after a reload:** Saving a system from the world editor, including the system tree, solar day, and atmosphere, now writes the change into this browser. A failed save no longer erases the stored map first. If the stored map cannot be read, the screen says so, the navigation stays usable, and nothing is written back over the copy already stored. Allegiance names and colours, sector names, subsector names, and sector review tags are kept in the browser and in a map file, and loading or clearing a map replaces them instead of leaving the previous map's. Clear Canvas waits for a save already in progress before it wipes storage.
9. **Player knowledge is paused:** Settings now has **Player knowledge (experimental)**, off unless you turn it on. Off, the D button, the action-bar menu, the two right-click items, the D shortcut, and the players' fog-of-war export are hidden. Export offers only **Referee — everything**. Tags already on hexes stay in the save and come back on load. Turning the flag on brings the same controls back; it does not change what those tags mean.

### [v0.17.5] - In Progress
1. **New — routes can be added again:** The Route Manager has always started with nine routes and quietly topped itself up: whenever every route was in use, opening the window added an empty one to work with. What it would never do is add a **second** one, which meant deleting routes only ever worked in one direction. A map cut down to three routes, one of them empty, simply stayed that way — the top-up saw a free route, decided nothing was needed, and there was nothing anywhere to click. The map was stuck at three routes until all three were filled, and no amount of deleting helped, because deleting is what got you there. A new **+ Add Route** button at the top of the Route Manager adds one whenever you want one, however many you already have and whether or not any of them are empty. It arrives wearing the first of the nine standard route colours **not already on the map**, so a map whose routes have been deleted and rebuilt no longer comes back as a column of identical green, and carrying the lowest number key **1–9 not already in use** as its shortcut — deleting a route frees its key, so a rebuilt map gets its keys back rather than losing them permanently. The cursor is placed in the new route's name ready for you to type over it, and **Ctrl+Z** removes it again, exactly as it does a deletion. Routes added automatically get a colour and a shortcut key of their own in the same way, instead of always arriving green with no key
2. **Route Manager — a scrollbar appeared across the bottom, and the colour swatches were squashed:** Opening a route's automation — Custom Point-to-Point most obviously, because its panel is the tallest — made the Route Manager sprout a horizontal scrollbar along the bottom, and the delete cross at the end of each row disappeared under the edge. The window was 430px wide inside, but a route row needs **467px** before it will fit at all and **480px** to sit at its natural size: eleven controls and ten gaps between them. Every row was therefore already being squeezed below its own minimum, which is why the colour swatch — specified at 50px — was rendering as a **14px sliver** of colour that was hard to tell one route from another by. Opening an automation panel made the list tall enough to need a vertical scrollbar, that took away another seventeen pixels, and what had been a squeeze became an overflow. The window is now **520px** inside, which fits a row at its natural width with the vertical scrollbar present and room to spare. The colour swatches are back to their full size and are legible at a glance again, nothing is clipped, and there is no horizontal scrollbar. The extra width over the strict minimum is deliberate: scrollbar widths and font metrics differ from machine to machine, and a window that only just fits on one would start scrolling again on another
3. **"Continue existing route" could not be ticked on routes it should have accepted:** Fixed the Continue box sitting greyed out and unusable on a route there was nothing wrong with. Two separate faults produced the same dead tick-box, and a long route built in passes could easily hit both. **Continue demanded more of a route than it needed.** It required a route that runs cleanly from one world to another, when all it actually needs is somewhere to grow from. That is not a fussy distinction: Point-to-Point works out each leg of a route separately, so a route with waypoints routinely comes out as something the old test rejected. A leg that routes back through a world an earlier leg used leaves that world visited twice — likely on any waypointed route and close to unavoidable on a round trip, where the way home retraces the way out. A leg that doubles back on the one before it hands back connections the route already has, which are recognised and skipped, leaving the world you turned around at as a **third loose end**; a waypoint behind you produces exactly that. Both were refused, above a tooltip saying the route had "no single end to continue from" when it had two or three. Continue now asks only that the route is in **one piece** and has **at least one loose end**, and offers every end it has: the tick-box lists them, the pre-filled Start is one of them and can be changed to another, and picking a world that is not an end still refuses and now names all of them rather than two. A **closed loop** is still refused, because it genuinely has no end anywhere, and so is a route sitting in **disconnected pieces**, because continuing it would grow one piece and quietly leave the rest behind — that one now points at the link button, which is the tool for joining them. Nothing else was loosened: combining routes and listing a route in travel order still require an unbroken line, and the tooltip says so when a continuable route is one that will list alphabetically. **A route with more than two ends now has its saved setup cleared when you continue it**, rather than kept. Such a route is not a single run of stops, so no Start/waypoints/End can describe it; keeping the old setup would show stops in the builder that no longer match the map, and a later ordinary Generate would rebuild the route from them and silently replace what you had. Continue itself is unaffected — it reads the route from the map every time — and the message says when this has happened. **The box also went stale.** It was set once, when the automation panel opened, and never looked again, so any change to the route made with the panel still open left it describing the route as it used to be. Drawing segments by hand is the case that bites, and it is the natural thing to do when a route stops short of where you wanted it: open the panel on an empty route, draw the route on the map, and the box stayed greyed out insisting the route had no segments. It is now re-tested whenever the route changes, **without disturbing a tick you have already made**. If the route stops being continuable while the box is ticked — you clear it, or undo past it — the box unticks itself and your Start, End and waypoints are put back exactly as Continue found them, rather than a rebuild being run from the fields Continue had rewritten
4. **Point-to-Point reported more segments than it drew:** Fixed the completion message counting segments that were never added. A route is not allowed to hold the same connection twice, so when one leg doubles back along the leg before it — which is what a waypoint behind you produces — those connections are recognised and skipped. The message was counting the length of the paths it had walked rather than the connections it had actually written, so it counted the skipped ones too. Measured on a two-leg route that doubled back: the message announced **9 segments over a map showing 6**. It now reports what was really drawn, which also means a continuation that turns out to add nothing new is correctly treated as having added nothing rather than claiming a number
5. **Continuing towards somewhere the route already reaches said "no path found":** Fixed a continuation that adds nothing being reported as a failure to find a route. Continuing from one end of a route towards a world that route already passes through finds a perfectly good path — and then every connection along it turns out to be one the route already has, so none are added. The result was reported with the message used when no path exists at all, naming the Jump number, which sent you off to raise a jump limit that was never the problem. It now says plainly that the route already connects those two worlds, so there was nothing to add. Nothing is changed on the map either way
6. **Deleting the last spare route said it had worked and left the route there:** Fixed a route you deleted reappearing immediately, under a message telling you it had been deleted. The Route Manager used to top itself up to one spare every time it drew, and deleting the last spare is exactly the moment that leaves none — so the row was removed and re-created in the same breath. It came back with the **same number**, since the number just freed was the next one available, the same colour and the same shortcut key, which made it indistinguishable from the row that had just been deleted. Nothing was wrong with the deletion itself; there was simply a new route standing where the old one had been. With the **+ Add Route** button now providing routes when you ask for one, the automatic top-up is both unnecessary and directly opposed to what Delete is for, so the Route Manager no longer performs it: a route you delete stays deleted, and you can now empty the list completely and build it back up from nothing. It still runs after importing routes from a file or from TravellerMap, where an import can fill every route and you have not just asked for one to go away. Separately, a new route no longer takes a number that **segments** are still using — deleting a route removes its own connections, but a route loaded from a file into a route that was later removed could leave some behind, and the next route created would have silently arrived with those connections already drawn on it

### [v0.17.4] - 2026-09-01
1. **New — a Point-to-Point route can now be continued instead of rebuilt:** Building a route has always been all-in-one: you enter every stop, press Generate, and get the whole route at once. To add one more stop to a finished route you had to enter all of the old ones again and rebuild it from scratch — which discards any hand-editing and re-finds nineteen legs that were already exactly right. A new **Continue existing route** tick-box in the Point-to-Point builder changes what Generate does: instead of replacing the route in that slot, it **adds to it**. Tick the box and the Start is filled in with the world at the end of the route and the End is left blank for you; enter where you want to go next, add waypoints if you want several stops at once, and generate. **The rest of the route is not touched** — not re-searched, not redrawn, not altered in any way — so a route you have adjusted by hand stays exactly as you left it. The Start must be one of the route's **two ends**, and it can be either of them, so a route can be extended backwards from its beginning as well as onwards from its end; picking a world from the middle is refused with a message naming the two ends you can actually continue from. Because the route's saved setup grows with it, reopening the builder afterwards still shows the whole route in travel order, and a later ordinary Generate rebuilds all of it rather than just the last piece. **The box is off every time the panel opens**, so Generate always means "rebuild" unless you have just said otherwise — it can never quietly add to a route when you expected to replace one. It works on **any** route that runs from one world to another, including ones imported from TravellerMap, loaded from a route file, or drawn by hand; where there is nothing to continue the box is greyed out and says why. A continuation that finds no path leaves the route completely untouched, and one **Ctrl+Z** takes the whole continuation back off
2. **New — two routes that meet can be combined into one:** A long route often ends up built in pieces — one section imported, another traced on the map, a third generated — and there has been no way to make them one route. Every row in the Route Manager now carries a **link** button that offers the routes which join this one **end to end**, and folds the one you pick into it. The route you clicked keeps its **name, colour and shortcut key**; the other route's connections move across, take on that colour, and its now-empty slot is removed, freeing its shortcut for something else. **Only combinations that produce a single unbroken route are offered.** Two routes that meet in the *middle* of one of them are not offered, because the result would be a fork rather than a line; neither are two that do not touch at all. The check is made on **what the combined route would actually look like**, not merely on whether their endpoints match, so a pair that meets at one end but doubles back over itself elsewhere is correctly excluded too — and, less obviously, a route that exists in two separate pieces **is** offered when the route you are combining it into happens to bridge the gap between them. The link button is only lit when something is actually available, so you can see at a glance which routes can be joined without clicking anything. You are asked to confirm first, told where the two meet and how many connections will move, and the whole thing is undone with **Ctrl+Z** — including bringing the absorbed route's slot back with its name and shortcut key intact
3. **Filters appeared to still be applied after closing and reopening the application:** Fixed the map coming back filtered — most of your worlds missing — while the filter fields themselves were empty, so there was nothing on screen to explain what had happened and nothing to clear. Applying a filter records, on every world, whether that world is currently hidden; that record was being saved along with the rest of the map, while the filter *fields* that produced it were not saved at all. Every other part of the application that reloads a map re-runs the filter afterwards and so corrected itself — only starting the application did not, which is exactly the case where the fields come back empty. **The effect went well beyond the map looking wrong.** Route generation obeys the filter, and it reads that same hidden/not-hidden record rather than the fields, so routes built after reopening were quietly restricted to whatever the forgotten filter had left visible: in testing, the same two worlds gave a nine-segment detour instead of the five-segment direct route, with nothing said. Meanwhile **Shift+F** replied "No filter is active" and refused to bypass anything, and Custom Network refused to generate for the same reason — the application insisting nothing was filtered while the map plainly was. The filter is now recalculated when the application starts, so the map and the filter fields always agree, and that record is **no longer saved at all** — neither in the application's own storage nor in a saved map file, so a map you send to someone else can no longer arrive filtered by a filter they never set. **A filtered map now says so**: a notice at the top of the screen reads "Filter active — showing 18 of 147 worlds" whenever anything is being hidden, and clicking it opens the Filter Manager. It appears only when worlds really are hidden, and it reports the bypass too, so a filtered map can never again be mistaken for an empty one
4. **Route Systems panel and CSV export could silently leave worlds out:** Fixed a route made of a line *plus* a separate closed loop of segments — which is easy to produce by hand, by dragging extra segments onto a route that already exists — being listed as though it were just the line. The panel decides whether it can list a route in travel order by looking for exactly two loose ends; a closed loop has none at all, so a route carrying one still looked like a simple line, and the list then stopped when it reached the end of the line and never mentioned the rest. A three-world route with a three-world loop attached listed **three of its six worlds**, in the Systems panel and in the CSV export alike, with no indication anything was missing. Such a route now lists **every** world it contains, in alphabetical order rather than travel order, which is the honest answer for a route that does not run from one end to another
5. **Route Manager — the CSV button now says "CSV":** The row had grown three file-shaped icons sitting together — export a spreadsheet, save the route, load a route — which were hard to tell apart without hovering over each one, and the new link button would have made a crowded row worse. The spreadsheet export is the one whose icon most misdescribed it, since it exports **the worlds a route passes through** rather than the route itself, so it is now a small button reading **CSV**. That leaves the two genuine route-file icons sitting together as a pair, which is what they are
6. **Undo after importing several sectors from TravellerMap:** Fixed **Ctrl+Z** after a multi-sector import appearing to undo the import while actually doing something quite different. The import took no undo record of its own and did not clear the existing ones, so Ctrl+Z reached back to whatever the last undo point happened to be — from *before* the import. The imported sectors did disappear, which made it look correct, but any editing done before the import was silently reverted along with them. Importing sectors is now treated the same way as importing the whole universe, which has always worked this way: it replaces so much of the map that it is a new document rather than an edit, so **the undo history is cleared** and Ctrl+Z afterwards does nothing at all rather than something unpredictable
7. **Route Manager:** Removed two more unused internal functions from the routing code — one built to fill a "clear routes" window that no longer exists, and its companion. Neither had ever been called from anywhere in the application. Like the duplicate removed in v0.17.2, they were the troublesome kind of dead code: plausible, well-commented, and sitting immediately beside live code doing a similar job, so a fix could reasonably have been applied to them and had no effect whatsoever — internal cleanup, no behavior change

### [v0.17.3] - 2026-08-27
1. **New — Point-to-Point can now build as far as it can get:** A Point-to-Point route that could not reach one of its stops used to fail outright, change nothing, and leave you to work out why on your own — which is fine for a short route you can simply rebuild, and painful on a twenty-leg route across half the Imperium, where "no path found" is the *start* of a research problem rather than the end of one. A new **Build as far as possible** tick-box in the Point-to-Point builder keeps the route instead: it is drawn up to the closest world it could actually reach, that world is named and ringed on the map, and the Route Systems panel says which stop was missed and by how many hexes. From there you add a waypoint near where it stopped and generate again to carry the route on. **Nothing about how routes are found has changed** — Max Jump is still never exceeded, the filter is still obeyed exactly as before, and Allow Empty Hexes still means precisely what it did. The only difference is what happens when the search comes up short: previously nothing, now the part it managed. **The box is off by default**, so a route that would have failed before still fails, changes nothing, and reports the problem exactly as it always has. A route that stops short says so wherever it is shown — on the map, in the panel, in the footer — and never claims to reach a stop it did not. **The ring is not something you have to clear**: it only ever means “the route ends here”, so it disappears by itself the moment that stops being true — when you regenerate the route, extend it past that point by hand, connect it through to the stop it missed, or delete those segments
2. **Point-to-Point — "no path found" now tells you how far it got:** The message named the leg that failed and the two stops it ran between, which tells you where the problem is but not what to do about it. It now also names **the closest world the search could actually reach, and how many hexes short of the stop that leaves it** — which is, in practice, the world you want to add as a waypoint to get around the obstacle. When the box above is switched off, the message also mentions that it exists. This applies whether or not you use the new option: it costs nothing, changes nothing on the map, and turns a dead end into a next step
3. **Point-to-Point — the completion message now names worlds, not hex numbers:** It read "generated: 14 segment(s) from 1-A-1910 to 1-C-2105". Every other message in the route builder names a stop the way the builder's own fields do — "Regina (1-A-1910)" — because a bare hex number is not something you can find on the map at a glance. This one now matches
4. **Point-to-Point — the top edge of a new waypoint field was clipped:** Adding a waypoint put the new field hard against the top edge of the waypoint list, which is a scrolling area and therefore trims anything that reaches past it. The focus outline a browser draws around the field it is typing in sits just *outside* the field, so the top of that outline was shaved off — slight, but visible every time, and always on the first waypoint. The list now leaves room for it at both ends. Nothing else about the list changed: it still holds the same number of rows before it starts scrolling
5. **Undo after importing routes from a TravellerMap XML file:** Importing routes creates route slots, and renames and recolours them to match the colours in the file. Ctrl+Z took the imported segments back off the map but left all of that behind — so you were returned to a map with the right routes and the wrong Route Manager, with no way to undo the rest. Undo now restores the route slots along with the segments
6. **Undo after loading a map file:** Loading a Map JSON replaces your route slots with the ones saved in that file. Ctrl+Z restored the previous map and its route segments but left the loaded file's route slots in place, so the segments came back belonging to slots that were no longer theirs. Both are now restored together

### [v0.17.2] - 2026-08-19
1. **Route Manager — the list of matching worlds never appeared:** Fixed the **Start**, **End** and **Waypoint** fields in the Point-to-Point builder finding worlds as you typed and then showing you nothing, which left no way to change a stop by name — you had to know its hex number or click it on the map. The list was being positioned against the Route Manager's own corner rather than against the screen, so it landed roughly 110 pixels below the field it belonged to, on top of the waypoint rows; and once the window had been dragged right of or below where it opens, the list moved outside the window altogether and was clipped away entirely — found, built, and invisible. It is now attached to the page rather than to the window, so it appears directly beneath its field wherever the Route Manager has been dragged to, and still flips above the field when there is no room below. **This has been broken since v0.16.2.1**, where the list was set free of its panel so that a long waypoint list could no longer cut it off
2. **Route Manager — a route that cannot be built no longer destroys the one you had:** Fixed every route generator emptying the route slot *before* it began looking for paths, so a run that found nothing left you with neither a new route nor your old one. **Point-to-Point** was the worst of it: it drew each leg the moment it found one, so a route that failed on its third leg left the first two lying on the map — segments belonging to a route you never got, matching no setup the Route Manager could show you, and indistinguishable from real ones. Deleting a waypoint is precisely what stretches a leg past your jump range, so editing a long route was the usual way to land in this state. Generation is now all-or-nothing for **Point-to-Point, Custom Network, BTN and XBoat** alike: when nothing usable comes out, the map, the route and the undo history are left exactly as they were. Each of those also now says plainly that it produced nothing, rather than leaving you to discover an emptied slot
3. **Point-to-Point — "no path found" now names the leg that failed:** The message named the route's own Start and End, which on a long route points at the two stops least likely to be the problem: a twenty-waypoint route that could not get from stop 7 to stop 8 reported "no path from A to T". It now reads **"No path for leg 2 of 4: Rhylanor (1-A-0504) → Farhaven (1-C-2105) within Jump-2"**, naming stops the way the builder's own fields name them instead of as bare hex numbers; a single-leg route says so without the leg count. Separately, a stop that is marked as a system but carries no system data — which happens on part-built and some imported sectors — now says exactly that, instead of failing as a mysterious "no path found"
4. **Route Manager — duplicate empty route slots:** Fixed the first **Point-to-Point**, **Custom Network** or **BTN** generation on a route slot silently adding a second, empty slot to the Route Manager, carrying the same name and colour as the route being generated. It held no segments and had no shortcut key, but it sat directly beneath the real one, so a later attempt to regenerate or edit that route could easily be aimed at the wrong row — leaving the original still drawn on the map with no obvious way to remove it. New ones are no longer created. For sectors that already contain them, the Route Manager now shows a notice offering to clear them out, listing exactly which slots will go and undoable with Ctrl+Z. **Only slots holding no segments and no saved setup are ever offered**, so a genuine route rebuilt from an older save file is never touched
5. **Undo — deleting a route can now really be undone:** Deleting a route from the Route Manager promised the deletion could be undone with Ctrl+Z, but only its map segments came back — the route slot itself stayed gone, leaving those segments belonging to a route that no longer existed. Undo now restores the route slots themselves for actions that add or remove them, and the Route Manager repaints to match. A route's **name, colour, shortcut key and visibility are deliberately left alone by undo**, because those are changed without recording an undo step of their own — otherwise undoing something unrelated, such as painting a hex, would silently revert a rename made afterwards
6. **Route Manager:** Removed a second, unused copy of the internal function that keeps a spare route slot available in the list. It had sat in `js/routes.js` since it was written, but the Route Manager assigns the same function later and had always replaced it, so nothing had ever called it. The two copies had drifted apart — a different colour for a newly created slot, and different behaviour on a sector holding no route definitions at all — which made it the more troublesome kind of dead code: a fix applied to the copy in the file named after routes would have had no effect whatsoever, with no indication why — internal cleanup, no behavior change
7. **New — Save and load a single route:** A route can now be written to a file and loaded back in, from two new buttons on every row of the Route Manager. **Save** writes that route's connections to a small `.json` file named after it (`route_Spinward_Main.json`); **Load** reads one back into the row you clicked. This is not the **⬇** beside it, which exports a spreadsheet of the *worlds* a route passes through and cannot be read back in — the new file holds the connections themselves and nothing else. **A route file carries no name and no colour.** A loaded route takes the name, colour and shortcut key of the slot you load it into, so nothing of yours is ever overwritten and there is nothing to reconcile: set a slot up the way you want the route to look, then load into it. Loading into an empty slot happens straight away; loading into one that already has segments asks first, then replaces them, and **Ctrl+Z restores what was there**. Loading the same file twice leaves one route rather than two copies drawn on top of each other, and a route spanning several sectors is saved and restored whole. A route file only works on a map with the same sector grid it was saved from — if the grid differs the load is **refused with an explanation** rather than silently drawing the route in the wrong place, and the same goes for a file that is damaged, written by a newer version, or that refers to a hex this map does not have. In every one of those cases the map is left exactly as it was
8. **Route generation on large maps — no longer freezes the application:** Building a route across an imported universe used to lock the app up completely — no redraw, no response to clicks, no progress of any kind — because the pathfinder answered "what is within one jump of here?" by measuring the distance to **every world on the map**, once for every step it considered. On a single sector that is invisible; on a full Imperium import it was not. A nineteen-leg route across roughly 16,000 worlds froze the application for **25 seconds**, long enough that a browser may offer to close the tab. The same route now takes **0.2 seconds**. Worlds are grouped by position so the search looks only at the neighbourhood it is actually in, and each step no longer copies the whole route-so-far. The improvement grows with the map: barely measurable on one sector, around 25× on a few thousand worlds, and over 100× on a full Imperium. **Routes themselves are completely unchanged** — every route type was generated before and after the change across nineteen scenarios covering all four generators, empty-hex traversal, filters, cross-sector routes and unreachable destinations, and all 2,603 resulting segments are byte-for-byte identical. **All four route types benefit**, not just Point-to-Point, since they share one pathfinder

### [v0.17.1] - 2026-08-19
1. **World Details — Save button unreachable on smaller screens:** Fixed the World Details window hanging off the bottom of the display on any browser window shorter than about 770 pixels, which put the **Save** and **Cancel** buttons below the edge of the screen with no way to scroll to them — the window's own scrollbar moves its contents, not its frame, so the buttons simply could not be reached. The window opens 50 pixels from the top but was allowed to be 95% of the screen tall, two settings that can only both hold on a display over 1000 pixels high; it is now measured from where it actually opens. **Nothing changes on larger screens** — the window has never been tall enough there for the limit to apply — and the window's layout, size and position are otherwise untouched
2. **Shortcut list — corrections:** The in-app **Help & Shortcuts** panel and the startup screen both now list **D — Open Player Disclosure**, which has been available since the fog-of-war release but was never written down anywhere in the application. The **A** key has been removed: it opened an Allegiance Manager window that no longer exists, so it did nothing at all while still swallowing the keypress — which meant a route slot could not use "a" as its shortcut key. That key is now free. Assigning allegiances is unaffected and remains on the right-click menu, as do the allegiance field and filter
3. **Referee Notes — now resizable:** The Referee Notes box in the World Details window was fixed at about three visible lines, which made a long entry a chore to read or edit. It now opens at twice that height and can be **dragged taller by its bottom-right corner**, up to 70% of the window height, and the size you choose is remembered for next time rather than resetting every session. It resizes vertically only, so the panel's layout cannot be pushed out of shape, and it will not shrink below its original three lines. Save and Cancel stay pinned at the bottom of the window however tall the box gets
4. **New — Suspend the filter with Shift+F:** Building a route or reading the map with a filter on means most of the sector is invisible, and closing the Filter Manager leaves nothing on screen to remind you the filter is still there. **Shift+F** now bypasses it: every world reappears, and pressing Shift+F again puts the filter back exactly as it was. Nothing is retyped — the filter's settings are never touched, only ignored while you look. A message confirms each switch, and the bypass is deliberately forgotten when you close the app: it is a way of looking at the map, not a property of it, so it is never saved with a sector and never lands in the undo history. The filter also restores itself the moment you re-engage with it — opening the Filter Manager, or editing any filter field — since a bypassed filter would otherwise contradict the very criteria you are typing. **The bypass affects the screen only.** Route generation continues to use the real filter, so a Custom Network built while the map is bypassed still connects your filtered worlds rather than the whole sector; the Route Manager says so plainly while a bypass is active. Styling rules are unaffected — those have their own per-rule toggles. Pressing Shift+F with no filter active simply says so
5. **New — Point-to-Point routes can be built by clicking the map:** Every world field in the Point-to-Point builder (Start, End, and each waypoint) now has a **◎** button beside it. Click it and the next system you click on the map fills that field — the cursor becomes a crosshair, a banner tells you which stop you are setting, and the Route Manager stays open the whole time. Panning and zooming still work while a pick is waiting, so you can navigate to the world you want; only a click that doesn't drag counts. Picking the Start when the End is still blank arms the End next, so a simple two-stop route is two clicks. Empty hexes may be picked too — see the next entry. **Esc** or the banner's Cancel ends a pick without closing the window
6. **New — Deep space stops:** A Point-to-Point route's Start, End, and waypoints can now be **empty hexes**, for referees who let players jump into deep space. Click one on the map or type its hex ID and the field reads "Deep Space (1-A-1910)" in amber, so an intended void stop is never mistaken for a misclick on blank space. There is no setting to turn on — deliberately choosing an empty hex is the opt-in — and in particular this does **not** require **Allow Empty Hexes**, which controls something different: whether the router may pass *through* empty hexes of its own accord while finding a path. A deep-space stop is a destination rather than a hop of convenience, so it never counts against **Max Empty Jumps**, and neither does starting in one. The hop to it still obeys Max Jump like any other, so an unreachable one fails as it always did. Such stops appear as "Deep Space" in the route's system list and CSV export. **Whether the jump is legal at your table, and what it costs in fuel or risk, remains your ruling — the tool takes no position**
7. **Allow Empty Hexes — now works on hand-built sectors:** Fixed the existing "Allow Empty Hexes" option finding no empty hexes at all on maps that were not imported. The router recognised only hexes explicitly marked EMPTY, but a hex means "empty" in three different ways: never touched at all, marked empty by hand or by a generation pass, or turned into a plain record when it was tagged with a region, allegiance or disclosure level. Only the second was recognised. Since importing a sector marks every unused hex as empty, the option worked perfectly on imported sectors and did nothing on hand-drawn ones — with no indication why. All three now count as empty space everywhere in the router. **Existing routes are unchanged**; this only affects paths generated from now on, which may find shorter routes through gaps they previously could not cross
8. **Point-to-Point:** Fixed a latent flaw where a route leg ending on an empty hex would search until it gave up and report "no path found" even when the destination was a single jump away — the search recognised arrival only at populated worlds
9. **New — Build Route on Map:** A button at the top of the Point-to-Point builder turns the panel into a running route-tracer. The first click sets the Start and the second sets the End; from there, each further click becomes the new End and the previous End drops into the waypoint list. Clicking A, B, C, D therefore leaves Start A, End D, and waypoints B and C in travel order — you trace a route across the map in the order you would fly it, instead of typing fifteen names and then reordering them. Clicking the same system twice in a row is ignored so a double-click cannot add a stop twice, and the mode starts from an empty route: if anything is already filled in, you are asked first whether to clear it. Finish with **Done** or **Esc** — the fields are left filled for editing, and nothing is drawn on the map until you press Generate

### [v0.17.0.1] - 2026-08-10
1. **New — Player Disclosure (Fog of War), groundwork:** Each system can now carry a *disclosure level* controlling how much of it a future players' export will reveal — from "Unknown" (the system does not appear at all), through star presence, stellar details, gas giants, system layout, physical data and population, up to the full UWP. Set it by selecting any number of hexes and choosing **Assign Player Disclosure** from the right-click ASSIGN menu; the window shows what the current selection holds before you change it, and the change is undoable with Ctrl+Z. Levels are saved with your sector file. Existing maps are unaffected: every system without a level set counts as fully disclosed, so nothing is hidden until you choose to hide it
2. **New — Players' Wiki Export (Fog of War):** The Export Wiki window gains a **Version** dropdown: *Referee — everything* (the export you have always had, unchanged) or *Players — fog of war*. The players' version writes the same wiki trimmed to each system's disclosure level: systems set to Unknown are left out entirely — no page, no index row, no filename — and everything else shows only what that level permits. Stars appear at "star present", spectral details next, then gas giants, then the system's layout and its name, then worlds' size, atmosphere and temperature, then population and tech level, and finally the full UWP. Below full disclosure, worlds and moons are shown as "World 1", "Moon 2" rather than by name, and the system orrery image is redrawn to match; world images only appear once the physical data they depict does. **Referee notes are never exported at any level.** Both formats are supported — Obsidian and HTML — and the players' ZIP is named distinctly so it cannot be confused with yours. **The subsector map is drawn to match**: systems you have not disclosed do not appear on it at all, and the rest show only what their level allows — a bare dot, then a gas giant marker, then a name, and only at full disclosure the starport, UWP and bases. System orrery images are redrawn the same way
3. **Right-click menu:** Fixed submenus running off the bottom of the screen, which could leave their last entries — most noticeably **Assign Player Disclosure**, the newest one — invisible and unreachable. Submenus are now positioned to stay fully on screen wherever you right-click and however short the window is, instead of merely flipping upward, which only moved the problem to the top edge. Also fixed the check running only the first time you hovered a submenu, so opening one, moving away and coming back could leave it mispositioned
4. **Players' Wiki Export — body counts:** Fixed a players' export still revealing how many worlds, belts, gas giants and moons a system has at levels below *System Layout*. Each body kept its own section and contents entry — blank, but present — so a system disclosed only as "star present" still listed 45 bodies by number and type; in the Obsidian format each body also kept its own file. Bodies now appear only from *System Layout* onward. Gas giant **presence** at the *Gas Giants* level is shown as a single "Gas Giants: Present" line with no number, matching the subsector map, which has always drawn one marker however many there are; the count arrives with the bodies themselves. Also fixed stars publishing their spectral type at *Star Present* — one level early — through the page header and the Obsidian page's hidden metadata, and world pages carrying their UWP, starport and trade codes in that same hidden metadata
5. **New — Player Disclosure window (D):** A new window showing every system in a sector or subsector with its disclosure level, so you can see the whole picture instead of checking one selection at a time. Systems run down the left, the eight levels across the top with a live count under each, and one click on a row sets that system's level — undoable with Ctrl+Z like any other change. Sort by hex, name or level, search by name or hex, or set every system shown at once. **A system you have never set counts as fully disclosed**, so those are called out in amber both per row and in a warning line at the top — telling you, for example, "159 of 201 systems shown have never been set". Open it with **D**, or from the right-click menu under MANAGERS.
6. **Wiki Export — rounding:** Physical values in both wiki exports no longer run to a dozen decimal places. Architect of Worlds in particular stored raw calculated figures, so a world's mass read "5.980074992877245 M⊕" and its orbit "3.1104000000000003 AU"; these now read 5.98 M⊕ and 3.11 AU. The rule is at most two decimals but always at least two meaningful digits, so genuinely small values are not flattened — a moon of 0.0131 Earth masses stays 0.013 rather than collapsing to 0.01, and a faint companion star's luminosity reads 0.0000041 rather than 0.0000040901847192818184. Verified across all five engines against 67,052 exported values: 3,677 changed, none lost, none distorted, and no field added or removed. **Generated data is untouched** — this is purely how numbers are displayed, so your saved sectors are unchanged. In-application panels are not yet covered
7. **World images — exports now match the application:** Fixed a bug where the world images in an exported wiki were different planets from the ones the application shows for the same worlds — different continents, different ice caps, different coastlines, despite identical UWPs. The two were generating their surfaces from different starting values, so neither was "wrong", they simply never agreed. Reported against a players' export, but it affected **every** export, referee and players' alike, in both the Obsidian and HTML formats and in all five rule sets. The same fix corrects a second problem in the application: every world and moon in a single system was drawing the *same* landmass, recoloured for each world's ocean and atmosphere, because they all shared one starting value — so two very different worlds in one system looked like the same planet painted twice. Each body now has its own surface, and that surface is the one you see wherever you look at it: the world image panel, the flat map, and both wiki exports. **Your existing worlds will look different from before** — this changes only how a surface is drawn, never any generated data, so nothing in your saved sectors is altered
8. **Wiki Export — worlds showing the wrong world's data:** Fixed a bug where a world could be exported with **another world's physical details** — its mass, density, gravity, diameter, axial tilt, temperatures, atmospheric pressure, composition and water coverage — printed under the correct world's name. It happened wherever two bodies occupy the same orbit, which is perfectly normal: the exporter identified a body by its orbit rather than its name, and when two shared one, the second silently inherited the first's readings. Because it always borrowed from the world immediately before it, the page looked entirely believable, which is why it could go unnoticed. Mongoose Traveller only — the other four rule sets were never affected — and it reached both the Obsidian and HTML formats and both the referee and players' versions. The application itself was always correct, which is exactly why its figures disagreed with the export. In the reference sector this affected 14 worlds out of 688, plus three moons. **No generated data was ever wrong** — only what the export printed, and it now prints each world's own figures

### [v0.17.0] - 2026-08-03
1. **New — HTML Website Export:** The wiki export can now produce a browsable website instead of Obsidian Markdown, for users who don't use Obsidian. The menu entry is now **Export Wiki**, with a Format dropdown at the top of the export window offering "Obsidian Wiki (Markdown)" or "HTML Website"; every other option applies to both. The HTML version writes one page per system — its stars, worlds and moons become sections of that page with a contents list, rather than hundreds of separate files — plus a sortable, filterable index of every system in the subsector, the subsector map, and all the same world and orrery images. It needs no internet connection, no web server and no software beyond a browser: unzip it and double-click. Pages follow your system's light or dark setting, have a toggle to override it, and print legibly. Each subsector exports as its own ZIP that extracts into a shared sector folder, so subsectors you export at different times join up into one site rather than becoming disconnected islands
2. **Wiki Export:** Moved the exporter's shared machinery into a new internal module (`js/export_core.js`) — ZIP building, filenames, per-edition data lookup, world image rendering, and the definitions of every per-body field are now written once rather than being duplicated the moment a second export format exists. Each body's fields are also now recorded as structured data instead of pre-formatted Markdown text, which is what will later allow a single field to be shown or hidden per system. The exported wiki is byte-for-byte identical to before — internal cleanup, no behavior change
3. **Wiki Export (Architect of Worlds):** Fixed a bug where Architect of Worlds worlds and moons exported with almost none of their detail — every body showed only gravity, diameter and temperature, because the exporter had no way to find an AoW body at all. AoW is in fact the most detailed of the five engines. Worlds and moons now show distance, eccentricity, mass, density, gravity, diameter, axial tilt, albedo, mean temperature, atmospheric pressure, water coverage, breathability, world class, lithosphere and magnetic field; AoW mainworlds gain their full socioeconomic breakdown, which the exporter had been looking for in the wrong place; and naval, scout and corsair bases now appear in the HTML index. Affects both the Obsidian and HTML exports. A number of AoW-specific readings are still not shown pending confirmation of what they mean and what units they use
4. **Obsidian Exporter (RTT Traveller):** Fixed a bug where RTT Traveller worlds and moons exported with none of their detailed physical data — World Class, Chemistry, Biosphere, Rings, Habitation, Desirability, Industry, Starport and Terraforming Potential were missing from every RTT page, because the exporter looked for RTT bodies in a location the RTT engine has never stored them in. Every other edition was unaffected, as were RTT star pages and world lists, which is why the gap was easy to miss. A 45-system RTT subsector gains these fields on 453 worlds and moons


### [v0.16.2.1] - 2026-07-31
1. **Filter:** The System Name filter now accepts multiple comma-separated names (e.g. "Sol, Ara") and shows any system matching at least one of them, instead of only matching a single literal string; matching is now "contains" rather than "starts with"
2. **Obsidian Exporter:** World images can now be exported using a flat-map projection (Sinusoidal, Mercator, Mollweide, or Diamond) in addition to the existing Globe (Hemispheres) view, selectable from a new dropdown that appears when "Include world images" is checked
3. **Obsidian Exporter:** Fixed a bug where unchecking "Include system orrery images" also silently removed the subsector map image from the subsector index page, even though that image has nothing to do with per-system orrery snapshots; the subsector map image is now always included
4. **Route Manager (Point-to-Point):** The waypoint list now scrolls once it grows past roughly ten entries instead of being silently cut off — long routes previously hit an invisible ceiling around the eighteenth waypoint, where new rows were still added but could not be seen or reached
5. **Route Manager:** Each route slot now remembers the automation setup it was last generated with (type, start/end worlds, waypoints, jump, and every other parameter), so reopening a route to add or adjust waypoints no longer starts from an empty form; saved setups travel with the sector file
6. **Route Manager (Point-to-Point):** The Start, End, and Waypoint fields now show a world's name alongside its hex ID (e.g. "Regina (1-B-1910)") instead of a bare hex number, so a long waypoint list can be read at a glance; typing a bare name or a bare hex ID still works exactly as before
7. **Route Manager (Point-to-Point):** Waypoints can now be reordered with up/down controls and are numbered by position — previously the only way to move a waypoint was to delete every entry after it and retype them
8. **Route Manager:** Fixed a bug where exporting a route's systems to CSV frequently produced no file at all and took several attempts to work — the download was being cancelled by cleanup code that ran before the browser had finished reading the file. Also fixed the export button responding to a single click twice
9. **Route Manager:** The route CSV export window now names the file it will write, and a confirmation message reports the filename and world count once the export runs, so a failed download is no longer indistinguishable from a successful one
10. **Filter:** Fixed a bug where the Stellar Info filters (Class, Type, and Subtype) matched no worlds whatsoever in Classic Traveller, Traveller 5, and Revised Traveller sectors — those three engines record a star's spectral type, luminosity class, and subtype under different internal names than Mongoose and AoW, and the filter recognised only the Mongoose form. All five engines now filter correctly
11. **Filter:** The Stellar Info section no longer disappears when a sector has no star data — it stays visible but disabled with an explanation, instead of vanishing with no indication of why or how to bring it back. Relatedly, any criterion whose underlying data is absent from the sector (stellar Class/Type/Subtype, plus Gravity, Temperature, T5 Ix, Importance, WTN, and GWP) is now cleared when its control becomes unavailable and the results are refreshed immediately — previously such a criterion kept filtering invisibly and could hide every world in the sector with no visible control to explain the result
12. **Saving & Exports:** Applied the download fix from item 8 to every other export in the app — sector JSON save, chunked (multi-part) save, generation logs, TravellerMap route and metadata XML, sector .tab export, the Obsidian wiki ZIP, and filter rule export all used the same pattern that could cancel a download before the browser had finished writing it. The risk scaled with file size, so the largest exports were the most exposed. Every download now runs through a single shared routine rather than eight separate copies of the same code
13. **Saving (large maps):** A multi-part save now reports what actually happened instead of always claiming success — if any part fails to write, you get an explicit warning naming the missing parts rather than a "saved" message for an incomplete set that would only reveal itself much later as a failed load. The confirmation message now also asks you to check that every part is present, since all of them are required to reload the map
14. **Generation Logs:** Fixed a bug where the in-memory generation log was discarded the moment a log download was triggered, even if that download failed — leaving no way to re-export it. The log is now kept unless the download was successfully handed off to the browser

### [v0.16.2.0] - 2026-07-30
1. **System Editor:** Refactored the internal logic that tracks which fields a user has manually edited (star spectral type/class, mainworld flag, orbit position, derived stellar properties, UWP seed digits, moon orbit distance) onto the app's existing shared tracking mechanism instead of 29 separate copies of the same logic scattered across the file — internal cleanup, no behavior change
2. **System Editor:** Consolidated duplicated mainworld-name-preservation and system-commit logic shared by the "↻ Regenerate this body" button and the main Preview/Fill & Save path into one shared internal function — internal cleanup, no behavior change
3. **System Editor:** Hoisted a duplicated companion-star default-orbit lookup table into a single shared constant — internal cleanup, no behavior change
4. **System Editor:** Consolidated three separate copies of the White Dwarf/Brown Dwarf default spectral-class rule (used on the primary star, companion star, and system-creation dialog's Type dropdowns) into one shared function, removing the risk of the rule drifting out of sync between copies — internal cleanup, no behavior change
5. **System Editor:** Consolidated the duplicated "Seed UWP digits" input-box builder (body-level and moon-level) into one shared function — internal cleanup, no behavior change
6. **System Editor:** Made a star's "Derived Properties" panel (Mass/Lum/Diam/Temp/MAO) data-driven instead of five near-identical copies of the same field-editing code — internal cleanup, no behavior change
7. **Traveller 5 Engine (pre-overhaul cleanup):** Fixed a bug where every System Editor Preview/Fill & Save on a freshly-created T5 system threw an error and failed to commit anything — a star's luminosity value wasn't kept in sync between two internal copies of the same field, and T5's own generation-logging code crashed when it read the stale one
8. **Traveller 5 Engine (pre-overhaul cleanup):** Fixed a bug where creating a T5 system with only a mainworld (no other bodies added) ignored the "Allow engine to add additional bodies" setting and rolled a full set of random extra worlds anyway, instead of staying as the single body the user created
9. **Traveller 5 Engine (pre-overhaul cleanup):** Fixed a bug where a body's moon count could randomly change (grow or shrink) every time a T5 system was re-previewed or re-saved with no edits, instead of staying stable
10. **Traveller 5 Engine (pre-overhaul cleanup):** Fixed a bug where a world's Government, Law Level, Starport, and Tech Level were re-rolled to new random values every time an existing T5 system was re-previewed or re-saved, instead of keeping their previously generated values
11. **Traveller 5 Engine (pre-overhaul cleanup):** Fixed a bug where a companion star added or moved in the System Editor got an invalid orbital position baked into the system, instead of appearing at the distance the user actually placed it
12. **Traveller 5 Engine:** A newly created T5 system's mainworld now gets a properly generated UWP (starport, size, atmosphere, population, government, law, tech level) instead of always using the same placeholder value; typed "Seed UWP digits" now correctly influence the result
13. **System Editor (Traveller 5):** T5 moons no longer show a non-functional "Orbit" distance field (T5 doesn't model physical moon distance the way other editions do); users can now drag-and-drop reorder a body's moons directly, matching how T5 actually represents moon position (an ordered sequence, not a measured distance)
14. **System Editor (Traveller 5):** Creating a new T5 system now shows the star in the System Viewer's orrery immediately after choosing its class and type, matching the existing Mongoose and Classic Traveller behavior, instead of waiting until a body has been added
15. **Traveller 5 Engine / OTU Import:** Fixed a bug where a T5 system with 5 or more stars (rare, but allowed under the rules) had every star past the 4th collapse onto the same "Far" role at the same orbit, indistinguishable from one another; stars are now correctly assigned as Close/Near/Far/Companion up to the full 8-star maximum, with Close/Near/Far orbits placed using the real dice-roll ranges instead of fixed placeholder distances
16. **OTU Import (Traveller 5):** Importing a TravellerMap sector no longer loses each star's real spectral type — imported stars used to silently display as a generic "G V" in the System Editor regardless of their actual imported type; they now show their correct type immediately after import, even before the system has been expanded
17. **Mongoose Engine:** Fixed the same "5+ star collapse" bug (see above) for Mongoose — expanding an imported OTU system with 5 or more stars using the Mongoose engine instead of Traveller 5 now correctly assigns Close/Near/Far/Companion roles up to the full 8-star maximum instead of colliding every extra star onto "Far"; Close/Near/Far orbits now use Mongoose's own real dice-roll ranges instead of fixed placeholder distances
18. **Traveller 5 Engine:** Fixed a bug where a Gas Giant's diameter (and therefore its moons' orbital speed in the System Viewer's orrery) was wildly wrong whenever its size letter was R or S — those two letters were being misread as Classic Traveller's unrelated Ring/Small-moon codes instead of their real Traveller 5 gas-giant size values, producing a diameter of roughly 1,000-5,000 km instead of the correct 250,000+ km
19. **Traveller 5 Engine:** Fixed a bug in the Large Gas Giant size table where the single most likely roll produced an invalid, blank size code instead of the correct letter, silently breaking that gas giant's diameter, mass, and gravity
20. **Traveller 5 Engine:** Fixed a bug where a moon generated in a system's Inner or Habitable Zone could come out as a Hospitable, Inferno, Stormworld, or InnerWorld — types reserved for primary planets — instead of being rolled on the correct satellite-only table (Worldlet/IceWorld/BigWorld/RadWorld)
21. **Traveller 5 Engine:** Fixed a bug where a Radworld's Size used the same fixed roll as a Stormworld's instead of the standard roll every other world type uses
22. **Traveller 5 Engine:** A world or moon with Size 0 now always gets Atmosphere 0, matching the rules; previously only Belts and Infernos enforced this, so a Size-0 Worldlet could still roll a stray non-zero atmosphere
23. **Traveller 5 Engine:** Fixed the number of moons a body generates — it now uses the correct dice modifier for that body's own position in the system (Gas Giants; Inner-, Habitable-, and Outer-zone worlds each have their own modifier per the rules) instead of one flat formula for all Gas Giants and another flat formula for everything else, neither of which matched the rules for most positions

### [v0.16.1.0] - 2026-07-16
1. **Classic Traveller Engine:** Moons of gas giants and terrestrial worlds are now generated and stored in orbital-distance order, so a moon's name/letter always matches its actual distance from its parent (previously only the displayed name reflected distance — the underlying list order did not, so the System Editor and accordion could show them out of sequence)
2. **Classic Traveller Engine:** Fixed a bug where moons had no Distance (AU) or Temperature (K) shown in the accordion — moons never inherited a distance-to-star value, silently breaking the temperature calculation
3. **Classic Traveller Engine:** Fixed a bug where a moon's Mass could display with excessive decimal places and overflow its field in the accordion
4. **Accordion (Classic Traveller):** Reworked the star/body/moon stat layout to a label/value grid so values line up consistently instead of long labels crowding out their values and short labels leaving unused space
5. **Accordion (Classic Traveller):** Removed a redundant "Satellite" label and index number from each moon's summary row that could run together with the moon's type (e.g. "SatelliteMoon"); added consistent spacing between items in all accordion summary rows
6. **Classic Traveller Engine:** Fixed a bug where moons of gas giants orbited far too fast in the System Viewer's orrery — gas giants (and terrestrial worlds/mainworlds) never had a real diameter recorded, so the moon-orbit calculation silently substituted Earth's diameter for the parent regardless of its actual size. Gas giant diameter is a placeholder pending an authoritative source; terrestrial/mainworld diameter now uses the same formula already trusted for moons, and is also now shown correctly in the accordion's Diameter (km) field, which was previously always blank for these bodies
7. **System Editor (Mongoose):** Fixed a bug where a system whose mainworld is a moon (e.g. of a gas giant) showed no mainworld highlighted in the System Editor's body list, and pressing Preview or Fill & Save would incorrectly elect a second mainworld instead of recognizing the existing one
8. **System Viewer:** Fixed a bug where enabling "Hide Mainworld" did not hide the highlighted ring and name label for a mainworld that is itself a Planetoid Belt, even though it correctly hid the highlight for all other mainworld types
9. **Traveller 5 Engine:** Fixed a bug where almost every T5 world showed Rotation as "Undefined (Referee Discretion)" — the tidal-lock check ran before the world had been placed into a star orbit, so it could never detect an orbit 0/1 world; rotational dynamics are now calculated after system expansion, once each body's real orbit is known
10. **System Editor (Classic Traveller):** Fixed a bug where changing a system's mainworld to a different body, then saving, could fail the auditor with "Mainworld count error: found 2, expected 1" — demoting a moon that had been the mainworld only cleared its mainworld flag, not its type, so the stale designation was carried into the next save alongside the newly chosen mainworld
11. **Classic Traveller Engine:** Fixed a bug where regenerating a Bottom-Up or Top-Down sector with the same seed could produce different systems each time — gas giant, planetoid belt, and (Top-Down) habitable-zone orbit placement were rolled with an unseeded random number generator instead of the seeded one used everywhere else, breaking reproducibility
12. **Revised Traveller Engine:** Fixed a bug where Ancients Site placement used an unseeded random number generator instead of the seeded one used everywhere else, so it wasn't reproducible when regenerating with the same seed
13. **System Viewer**: Added ring visuals for CT and MgT2E
14. **System Editor (Mongoose):** Updated belt input to allow user to include UWP
15. **System Editor:** Refactored system_editor.js to remove engine specific functions to their js scripts to allow further engine development without risking unexpected results in working engines.

### [v0.16.0.6] - 2026-07-04
1. **System Editor:** Unified the Fill & Save and Preview commit logic into a single internal function, removing duplicated code that could drift out of sync between the two
2. **System Editor (Mongoose):** Fill & Save now runs the UWP Auditor after generating the system; if it finds issues you'll get a warning with the choice to proceed anyway or go back and fix the system first
3. **Mongoose Engine:** Moved the seed-restoration logic (used when regenerating a System-Editor-authored system) out of the bottom-up generator into a shared helper module, so other engines can reuse it without duplicating the logic
4. **Mongoose Engine:** Consolidated duplicated audit-logging code between the two Mongoose generators (bottom-up and top-down) into one shared function, and fixed a fragile dependency check that could break if script load order ever changed — internal cleanup, no behavior change
5. **System Editor:** Replaced the scattered per-engine branches in the System Editor's internals with a single per-engine lookup, starting with Mongoose — internal architecture groundwork for adding more engines to the System Editor, no behavior change
6. **System Editor (Classic Traveller):** Classic Traveller systems can now be created and edited in the System Editor, matching functionality already available for Mongoose — add, remove, and edit stars, worlds, gas giants, belts, moons, and captured planets, then Fill & Save to regenerate
7. **System Editor (Classic Traveller):** User-set values (size, atmosphere, hydrographics, population) on Classic Traveller bodies are now preserved on Fill & Save instead of being silently rerolled
8. **System Editor (Classic Traveller):** Fill & Save now runs the UWP Auditor for Classic Traveller systems too; if it finds issues you'll get the same warning with the choice to proceed anyway or go back and fix, already available for Mongoose systems
9. **System Editor:** Extended the shared per-engine lookup (item 5 above) to Classic Traveller — internal architecture groundwork, no behavior change beyond enabling item 6

### [v0.16.0.5] - 2026-07-04
1. **System Editor (Mongoose):** Fixed bug where editing an already-generated system caused its socioeconomic data (Importance, RU, GWP, WTN, IR/DR, and all profile strings) to be silently rerolled instead of preserved
2. **System Editor (Mongoose):** Fixed bug where editing a system with existing socioeconomic data could cause that data to disappear from the display entirely
3. **Hex Map Rendering:** Fixed a graphical corruption bug where the map canvas could become visually garbled after a browser page-zoom change (e.g. Ctrl+Mousewheel) went unsynced from the canvas; the canvas now automatically resyncs whenever the browser's zoom/DPI changes

### [v0.16.0.4] - 2026-07-01
1. **System Details:** Fixed a bug where entire system details were marked as changed when one or more bodies were added

### [v0.16.0.3] - 2026-07-01
1. **System Editor:** Fixed bug where re-previewing a system could re-roll and re-sort moon orbital positions, making manually named/added moons appear shuffled or mismatched in the accordion view

### [v0.16.0.2] - 2026-07-01
1. **System Editor:** Allow user to override Atmosphere rules for size 0/S/1 worlds

### [v0.10.1.1] - 2026-05-08
1. **Changelogs:** Updated (had been incomplete)
2. **Mongoose Engine:**  Adjusted boiling and frozen temperature bands to align with atmosphere tables (which disagree with page 47 table)

### [v0.10.1] - 2026-05-08
1. **Routes:** X-Boat generation now writes to the selected route slot instead of always forcing to Slot #1 — each generation only clears and replaces segments in its own slot, leaving all other slots untouched
2. **Mongoose Engine:** Fixed missing HZCO deviation log entry for temperate (habitable-zone) planets — deviation and table selection are now recorded in the generation log for every planet regardless of temperature band
3. **Canvas:** Clear Canvas now also resets all sector names
4. **Routes:** Raised Max Empty Jumps cap for Point-to-Point routes from 3 to 10; Custom Network remains capped at 3
5. **Borders:** New Border functionality including Border Window, import borders from metadatafiles or add them manually via right-click context menu.
6. **Import:** Added selective import options to Import Imperium and Import Universe — a checkbox panel lets you choose which data to import independently: Sector Data, Route Data, Border Data, and Region Data (all enabled by default)
7. **Import:** Region Data import from TravellerMap metadata XML — parses `<Regions>` polygon boundaries using the same flood-fill algorithm as borders, assigns region names to each hex's Region (cluster) field, and automatically creates a background-highlight filter rule using the region's defined color
8. **Import:** Region name field expanded from 10 to 20 characters to accommodate longer TravellerMap region names
9. **Import:** TSV sector import now accepts 3-digit hex codes by automatically padding a leading zero, preventing rows from being silently dropped when the leading zero is missing
10. **Regions:** New Region functionality including Region Window, import regions from metadatafiles or add them manually via right-click context menu.
11. **Advanced Filter Rules:** Now have visibility checkboxes
12. **Mongoose Engine:** Updated temperature band calculation to match chart on Page 47

### [v0.10.0.3] - 2026-05-02
1. **Routes:** Removed legacy Xboat and Auto Routes modals and their event handlers; all route operations now go through the Route Manager
2. **Routes:** Increased jump range limit from 6 to 20 across all Route Manager panels (BTN, P2P, Network, Xboat)
3. **Mongoose Engine:** Rewrote HZCO deviation formula to use a continuous linear scale (sub-1 orbits scaled ×10) giving physically correct temperature classifications for inner-system worlds
4. **Routes:** Implemented BTN Trade Route generation (GURPS Far Trader inspired) — computes Basic Trade Number for all world pairs within range, draws routes for pairs meeting Min/Max BTN thresholds, promotes partial-success pairs whose BFS paths share a segment, and enforces no-shared-segment priority between competing BTN route slots
5. **Routes:** Xboat, Network, and BTN route generators now avoid Red travel zones and X starport worlds as intermediate routing hops (endpoints may still be Red)
6. **Routes:** Added Import Metadata (.xml) and Export Metadata (.xml) buttons for TravellerMap-format sector XML files — import routes grouped by color into chosen route slots; export all routes for a sector with route definition colors and cross-sector offset attributes for round-trip compatibility
7. **Export:** Fixed Ix, Ex, and Cx not being populated when exporting a Mongoose-generated sector — the exporter now reads Im/ecoR/L/I/E directly from the Mongoose engine output and uses the cultural profile D/X/U/S dimensions for Cx; also fixed a broken global reference that prevented the T5 socio fallback from firing for CT/RTT worlds
8. **Routes:** Added "Allow Empty Hexes" option to Custom Network and Point-to-Point route generators — when enabled, BFS can traverse hexes marked as EMPTY, subject to a configurable Max Empty Jumps (1–3) consecutive-hop limit before a populated system must be reached
9. **All Engines:** Added freeform **Cluster** field to all systems — displayed in the world info panel below Allegiance, editable inline (up to 10 characters), bulk-assignable via right-click context menu, and filterable in the Filter Control window using the same prefix-match OR logic as Allegiance; persists in JSON saves

### [v0.10.0.2] - 2026-04-25

3. **Routes:** Completely revamped routs including:
    * Custom names and colors
    * All routes can be autogenerated or manually created or edited
    * Easy access to route details including # jumps, # systems, list of systems

### [v0.9.3.2] - 2026-04-21
1. **Mongoose Orbit Placement Corrected:** The Mongoose 2E engine now selects the correct orbit-placement method based on the system's configuration. Standard systems place the reference orbit near the habitable zone.  
2. **OTU X-Boat Routes on Import:** When importing sectors from TravellerMap, the tool now also downloads each sector's official route data and displays the X-boat routes on the map as green lines. Routes that cross sector boundaries are correctly resolved. Route visibility can be toggled on and off using the existing Filter window controls.

### [v0.9.3.1] - 2026-04-19
1. **Gas Giant Quantity DMs Fixed:** Gas giant quantity roll now correctly applies all DMs from the data table — Single Class V (+1), Brown Dwarf primary (-2), Post-Stellar primary (-2), per post-stellar star (-1), and 4+ stars (-1). Previously only Single V (+2, incorrect) and 4+ stars were applied.
2. **Terrestrial Planet Logging Improved:** The terrestrial planet quantity log now explicitly shows the fixed -2 DM on the 2D6 roll, the base count and branch decision, and the D3-1 or D3+2 formula steps with correct dice types (1D3, not 1D6).

### [v0.9.3] - 2026-04-19
1. **Mongoose Editable System Fields:** All fields in the Mongoose Traveller 2nd Edition System Details accordion are now inline-editable — star names and classifications, physical properties (diameter, gravity, mass, temperature, luminosity, orbital period), and UWP for all non-mainworld bodies. Edited fields are highlighted and persist in the workspace JSON.
2. **Corrected Stellar Generation Tables:** Star physical properties (mass, diameter, surface temperature) are now derived from accurate per-luminosity-class tables with subtype anchors, rather than a single averaged value per spectral type. Giant, dwarf, and subdwarf stars now have physically distinct and correct statistics.
3. **Fixed Missing Companion Rolls for Primary Star:** Previously, only secondary stars (Close, Near, Far) received a companion roll. The primary star now also rolls for a companion, matching the full rules requirement that every star in the system gets a companion check.
4. **Improved Companion Log Labels:** Generation logs now clearly identify which star each companion roll belongs to (e.g. "Close Star: Companion Presence"), making it easier to trace multi-star system generation step by step.
5. **HZCO Updated for Primary Companions:** When the primary star gains a companion, the system's Habitable Zone Central Orbit (HZCO) is recalculated using the combined luminosity of both stars, ensuring mainworld placement reflects the true binary heat output.
6. **Per-World HZCO (Habitable Zone Accuracy):** Each world now receives its own HZCO calculated from only the stars interior to its orbit — secondary stars and their companion stars contribute to HZCO only for worlds in the appropriate subsystem. This prevents distant companion stars from artificially shifting the habitable zone for worlds they don't actually illuminate.
7. **Accordion Display Polish:** Fixed excessive spacing between labels and values in the Mongoose system accordion. Atmosphere gas components and taint entries are now capped at the top two results in the display, keeping the panel readable for complex atmospheres. Added atmospheric pressure to UI.
8. **Octagon Filter Symbol:** Added an octagon as a new shape option in the Advanced Filter styling panel.
9. **Gas Giant Ring Visibility:** The ring symbol on gas giants is now 2–3× thicker, making it clearly visible when zoomed out to subsector or sector scale.

### [v0.9.2] - 2026-04-16
1. **T5 Editable System Fields:** All fields in the Traveller 5 System Details accordion are now inline-editable — star type, decimal, and size class; physical properties (diameter, gravity, mass) for all worlds and moons; rotation state; climate zone; worldType (with a warning that changing it affects atmospheric generation on next re-expansion); and UWP for all non-mainworld bodies. Edited fields are highlighted and persist in the workspace JSON.
2. **T5 Body & Satellite Names:** Every planet and moon in a T5 system now has an editable name field in the accordion header, defaulting to the system name and orbit position (e.g. *Regina 3*, *Regina 3-a*).
3. **T5 Manual Field Preservation:** Manual edits survive system re-expansion — when a T5 system is regenerated, user-set values are restored onto the new system by matching star and orbit index. Only an explicit hex clear removes them.
4. **T5 Belt UWP Fix:** Planetoid Belts now correctly display and expose their full UWP for editing. Per T5 rules, belts receive social stats (population, starport, government, law, tech level); the previous renderer was incorrectly suppressing this.

### [v0.9.1] - 2026-04-16
1. **CT Editable System Details:** All fields in the Classic Traveller System Details accordion are now inline-editable — star classifications, physical properties (diameter, gravity, mass, temperature, rotation, axial tilt, distance, orbital period), and UWP for non-mainworld bodies. Edited fields are highlighted and persist in the workspace JSON. Manual edits survive regeneration where orbit positions match; only an explicit hex clear removes them.
2. **CT Body & Satellite Names:** Every planet, captured planet, and satellite in a CT system now has an editable name field in the accordion header, defaulting to Roman-numeral position names (e.g. *Regina III*, *Regina III-a*).
3. **Auto Route Jump Limit:** Maximum jump size for Auto Filter Routes increased from 8 to 20.

### [v0.9.0.2] - 2026-04-15
1. **MgT2E Life Roll Fix:** Corrected a bug where the biospherics engine rolled individually for life on every solid world in the system. Per WBH rules, only the mainworld (top-down) and habitable-zone worlds receive a full biomass evaluation; all remaining inhospitable worlds are resolved with a single collective 2D roll — a natural 12 means trace life exists on one randomly chosen body.

### [v0.9.0.1] - 2026-04-15
1. **Sector Name Display:** Added configurable sector name labels to the map. Names appear at zoom levels below 0.3 (when hex detail is suppressed), rendered at a 30° angle across each sector in the TravellerMap style. Names are auto-populated from Imperium and Universe imports, editable manually via a new "Edit Sector Names" grid dialog in the Settings panel, and persisted in the workspace JSON.

### [v0.9] - 2026-04-15
1. **RTT World Details Sync:** Edits made to a mainworld's UWP in the World Details panel now correctly propagate into the RTT System Details accordion — the two views stay in sync after every save.
2. **RTT World Naming:** Every body in an RTT system (planets, moons, gas giants, satellites) now has an editable name field directly in the System Details accordion header. Bodies default to auto-generated names derived from the system name and orbital position (e.g. *Regina III*, *Regina III-a* for its first moon). Custom names are saved per-body, persist with the system JSON, and are shown in italic to distinguish them from defaults. The mainworld name is also independently editable without changing the system name.
3. **RTT System Details:** Fields in the RTT System Details can be edited.

### [v0.8] - 2026-04-14
1. **Auto Filter Routes:** Added Auto Route generation from the Filter window — connect filtered worlds via shortest-path bridging, with custom color, jump range, and named route groups; rendered as a distinct "Filter" route layer beneath manual routes
2. **Point-to-Point Auto Routes:** Added point-to-point pathfinding between any two hexes, with optional restriction to filtered worlds only
3. **Zoom LOD Rendering:** At zoom levels below 0.3, hex grid lines, text, and icons are suppressed; only background fills and selections are drawn, significantly improving performance when zoomed out to sector or universe scale
4. **IndexedDB Persistence:** Added `db_manager.js` — automatically mirrors `hexStates` and `sectorRoutes` to IndexedDB so work survives browser refresh without a manual JSON save
5. **Route Layering:** Filter routes always render beneath manual (Xboat/Trade/Secondary) routes; all four types have independent visibility toggles in the Filter window
6. **Side-by-Side Route Offset:** Multiple routes sharing a segment are spread apart at zoom ≥ 0.3 so they remain individually visible
7. **Chunked JSON Save:** Workspaces exceeding 250 MB are automatically split into multiple numbered JSON parts on save; loading prompts the user to select all parts together so no data is lost on very large maps

### [v0.7.4] - 2026-04-13
1. **Import the Universe:** Added experimental bulk import of the full 16×8 OTU sector canvas
2. **Numeric Sector IDs:** Refactored hex IDs from letter-based to numeric (legacy JSON auto-migrated on load)
3. **Imperium Data:** Sector list now fetched live from travellermap API with correct OTU coordinates
4. **Canvas Scaling:** Sector and subsector grid lines now span the full canvas at any grid size
5. **Undo Stack:** Capped at 5 snapshots for canvases larger than 35 sectors to protect memory
6. **Zoom:** Extended zoom-out limit from 0.1 to 0.03
7. **API Courtesy:** Enforced 1-second delay after every live travellermap API call; sectors cached for 24 hours

### [v0.7.3] - 2026-04-12
1. **Mongoose Socioeconomic:** Fixed bug that did not check if Ix, Cx, or Ex could be inherited
2. **Mongoose System Expand:** Fixed bug that did not make use of T5 Stellar information and PBG
3. **Import Sector .tsv:** Fixed bug that did not capture Worlds value
4. **Generate Xboat:** Added user options on range and jump distances
5. **Import Imperium:** Added the option to bulk import Imperial Sectors

### [v0.7.2.1] - 2026-04-11
1. **Settings Menu:** Added Solo-6 button

### [v0.7.2] - 2026-04-11
1. **Filter Engine Expansion:** Added Belt and Travel Zone filters
2. **Filter UI:** Created new Filter section for Belts, GG, Zones
3. **All Engines:** Created Belt and GG counts to be used for filters in creation methods of all engines
4. **JSON Load/Save:** Ensured Belt and GG count included in all JSON saves, and added to any legacy JSON being loaded
5. **Sector Import:** Fixed bug that prevented Travel Zones from being imported

### [v0.7.1] - 2026-04-10
1. **Filter Engine Expansion:** Added "Gas Giant" and "Total Population" filters.
2. **Filter Engine Expansion:** Added the ability to use k, m, b as shorthand for thousands, millions, and billions in the total population filter
3. **T5 Pop mod:** Fixed a bug in the T5 engine producing Population mods of 0 when population > 0
4. **Hex Background:** Added as an option outside of filtering.  Hex backgrounds can be placed on selected hexes via the context menu.

### [v0.7] - 2026-04-07
1. **Political Mapping & Referee Utility:** Initiated Phase 7.0 development.
2. **Allegiance & Notes:** Implemented manual entry fields for Allegiance codes and Referee Notes in the Main World UI.
3. **Allegiance Selection:** Implemented a way to mass change Allegiance through selection and right click.
3. **Hex Background:** Added to filter styles
4. **White Background Mode:** Added in settings

### [v0.6.1] - 2026-04-07
1. **Statistical Auditor Integration:** The StatisticalAuditor is now fully integrated into all bulk generation macros (CT, MgT2E, T5, and RTT) within macro_orchestrator.js.
2. **Statistical Auditor Integration:** It now also triggers for single-system regeneration via the Context Menu. When you regenerate a single hex, the console will now output a specific "Subsector-scale" audit for that system, allowing you to see exactly how that system's properties align with expected Traveller distributions.
3. **Refined Thermal Physics (MgT2E):** Patched a significant scaling issue in mgt2e_world_engine.js. Previously, the tidal heat calculation for moons incorrectly used the star's mass instead of the parent planet's mass, leading to nonsensical temperature overflows. Internal heat (inherentK) is now physically capped at 200K to ensure consistent climate modeling.
4. **UI/Console Parity:** The StatisticalAuditor now outputs color-coded [PASS] and [STATISTICAL WARNING] flags directly to the browser console, providing immediate feedback on whether your current sector generation is matching the target RAW (Rules-As-Written) frequency tables.
5. **T5**: Fixed starport distribution; size 0 mainworlds now possible;
6. **CT**: Fixed atmosphere penalty for mainworlds in top down generation

6. **MGT2E**: Added Culture Quirks to world generation
7. **CT**: Built universal ct_stellar_engine.js to remove duplication between ct_topdown_engine.js and ct_bottomup_engine.js
8. **CT**: Unifying stellar generation fixed bugs in top_down and bottom_up companion generation
9. **CT**: Fixed orbital slot allocation
10. **CT**: Fixed Gas Giant presence in system generation
11. **CT**: Fixed mainworld as satellite frequency
12. **T5**: Refactored social engine (including TL) resolving infrequent systems with high tech levels


### [v0.5.7.3] - 2026-03-30
1. **Renderer**: Implemented logic to differentiate Gas Giant icons based on the main world's status as a planet or moon.

4. **Classic Traveller**: Resolved a bug affecting Gas Giant presence in system generation.
5. **Classic Traveller**: Fixed a bug in Gas Giant orbital slot allocation.
6. **UI**: Resolved a bug where the RTT System secondary window remained open after closing the hex editor.


### [v0.5.7.2] - 2026-03-29
1. **System**: Implemented **multi-color cycling** for Asteroid Belt clusters, allowing visual representation of multiple matching rules across individual rocks.
2. **Filter**: Integrated "Asteroid Belt" into the choice of Icon Styles and established a new **default rule** that automatically applies the belt icon to all Size 0 worlds.
3. **UI**: Expanded the Filter Engine suite with four new icon styles (**Square, Diamond, Rounded Rectangle, and Asteroid Grid**), each featuring stripe-based multi-color support and ring-boundary safety.

### [v0.5.7.1] - 2026-03-29
