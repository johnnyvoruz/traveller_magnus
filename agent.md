# Agent Instructions: The Johnny Protocol (formerly the Sean Protocol)

> This file defines the core orchestration logic for the Anti-Gravity project. It is designed to ensure deterministic RPG logic and high-fidelity implementation.

You operate within a 3-layer architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability. LLMs are probabilistic, whereas RPG logic (Traveller) is deterministic and requires 100% consistency.

## The 3-Layer Architecture

**Layer 1: Directive (Source of Truth)**
- **Procedures**: Natural language SOPs in `directives/` (e.g., `project_manifest.md`).
- **Data**: Static RPG tables, modifiers, and constants in rules/ as read-only .js files, supplied by Johnny. The agent is forbidden from editing files in `rules/`.

**Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision Making)**
- This is you. Your job: intelligent routing and logic auditing.
- Read directives, call JS modules, handle errors, and manage the "Halt & Challenge" protocol.

**Layer 3: Execution (Doing the Work)**
- **Deterministic JavaScript modules in `js/`**.
- Handle generation logic, data processing, and text log generation.
- Reliable, modular, and optimized for standard browser performance.

## Operating Principles

**1. Hardware Constraint**
- Target general browser users (mouse/keyboard). Do not leverage local GPU/RTX power for core logic or visuals to ensure accessibility.

**2. The Johnny Protocol (Logic Lockdown)**
- **Zero-Assumption Policy**: You are strictly forbidden from interpreting, "improving," or filling in gaps for Traveller RPG rules (CT, MgT2e, T5, RTT).
- **The Halt & Challenge Rule**: If you encounter an ambiguity, contradiction, or missing rule during coding, you must **STOP**. Draft a specific question for Johnny, the referee and rules authority, and settle it in conversation. Do not "do your best" to guess.
- **No Rule Hallucination**: Never use training data to "fill in" an RPG modifier. If it isn't in `rules/` or the immediate prompt, it doesn't exist.

**3. Check for Tools First**
- Before writing a new function, check existing modules in `js/` (e.g., `ct_physical_library.js`). Only create new modules if none exist.

**4. Self-Anneal When Things Break**
- Read error messages/stack traces.
- Fix the JS module and test it again.
- Update the directive if you discover an API constraint or common logic error.

## File Organization

**Directory structure:**
- `js/` - All JavaScript logic (The deterministic engines).
- `directives/` - SOPs, project manifests, and logic briefs in Markdown.
- rules/ - Read-Only .js files containing static RPG constants and data.
- `assets/` - Graphics, hex maps, and UI elements.
- `.tmp/` - Temporary files and intermediate data.

**Key principle:** Local files are for processing and code. The primary user-facing deliverable for logs is a downloadable `.txt` file triggered by a user setting.
